43 billion reasons why Apple is not Apple in China</h1>

	Apple is a company that has always asserted that whatever it does, at the heart of it is the consumer. Apple is a company that has always been champion of privacy and doing things the right way. Apple is a company that with its eco-friendly processes has always thought of the greater good. Apple is a company, however, that at times is not Apple when it comes to China. Events of the last few days have once again reasserted that. Apple CEO Tim Cook shared a memo with Apple employees in which he justified why Apple had removed an app from its App Store in China.

The app in question, according to Cook, was “used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law. Similarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.” The removal of the app comes a day after a scathing piece in China Daily criticised Apple for having a “poisonous” app.
