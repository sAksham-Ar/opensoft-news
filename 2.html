CHENNAI (TAMIL NADU): While the Wuhan Summit instilled new momentum and trust in India-China relations, the latest 'Chennai Connect' is the start of a new era in bilateral ties, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi while welcoming Chinese President Xi Jinping to the delegation-level talks during the last day of the second informal summit.  	</p>

The Prime Minister started off his remarks at the meeting in Tamil, welcoming China to the talks, which were held right after one-on-one discussions between Modi and Xi at the Taj Fisherman's Cove Hotel.
