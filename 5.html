NEW DELHI: The gloom in the Indian auto market has taken the sheen off the industry’s biennial mega show as some of the top makers, including Hero Moto, TVS, Royal Enfield, Honda Cars, Toyota, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and Audi have decided to give the event a miss. Others who are not participating are Jeep, Ford, Lexus, Fiat and Harley-Davidson, while companies such as Honda 2-wheelers and Nissan are still weighing their options, sources told TOI.

The expo, which is held at Greater Noida in February every two years, is pitched as India’s answer to mega auto shows held in global cities such as Detroit, New York, Geneva, Paris and Shanghai.
