<p>NEW DELHI/PUNE: The pain of auto sector continued for the 11th straight month, despite the onset of the festival season as overall sales declined 22.4%, heaping more pressure on a sector that is reeling from the impact of a demand slowdown. The auto industry, however, said there were early signs of some improvement and the full festival season - along with discounts and measures announced by the government - will help improve sentiment in the segment.

In Pune, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman acknowledged the slowdown and said the government, if needed, would unveil more measures to help the auto sector.
