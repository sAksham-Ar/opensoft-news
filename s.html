	BENGALURU: Marigowdana Doddi, a village in Kanakapura
	 located about 60km from Bengaluru city, has become a centre of attraction since Wednesday morning. This, after villagers here stumbled upon a skin which they believe is of a seven-headed serpent. The fact that it was found next to a temple has further raised curiosity among the locals, who believe the ‘mythological’ serpent might be existing in reality.

 As the news of multi headed snake started spreading through television channels and social media, hundreds of people from other villages in the taluk thronged the area to have a glimpse of the discarded skin. Many even offered kumkum and haldi around it. 	</p>
